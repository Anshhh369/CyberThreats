# CyberThreats

# Introduction 

It is crucial to ensure the safety and reliability of software programs in the fast-changing technological landscape of today. As the digital world grows, so do the hazards posed by bad actors looking to take advantage of software flaws. In this case, Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are utlizied to tackle these problems. This method improves the capacity to recognize and address potential security issues by enabling us to efficiently evaluate huge datasets for software vulnerabilities.

# Business Questions

1.	How can we use machine learning to collect and evaluate threat intelligence data so that we can proactively fight against new threats?
2.	Is it possible to utilize ML to improve email security by spotting phishing emails and harmful attachments?
3.	How might ML help automate and speed up incident response, such as determining the extent of an invasion of privacy and containing it?
4.	How can ML improve the accuracy of our security alerts so that our safety personnel can concentrate on actual threats?
5.	How can we use ML to evaluate the safety record of suppliers and third-party vendors?

# Methodology 

We start by acquiring the dataset you want to investigate. It can be supplied from a variety of sources, including databases, Excel, CSV, and APIs. The dataset will then be imported into Excel, R, Python (with Pandas), or another data analysis program of your choice. View a portion of the data using Pandas functions like.head(),. tail(), or. Sample() to obtain a sense for the data and its structure. Using Pandas'.info() method, you may look up the information types for every column, such as integers, floats, texts, and dates. Finally, using histograms and box plots, and density plots, we start to visualize the distribution of data to comprehend central tendency and spread. In addition, we use scatter plots, graphs with bars, line charts, and temperature maps to display relationships and trends. This involves constructing multiple graphs and charts to get insights.

Refine and iterate: Iterative data exploration is common. To find more complex patterns and trends, focus your inquiries and run deeper studies. As a result, we take thorough notes and record our findings, as well as any data cleansing or preprocessing procedures carried out throughout the investigation. After investigating the data, take any necessary steps to clean up and preprocess it to address any data quality problems, missing numbers, or discrepancies. 

Data exploration is an ongoing process since the knowledge gathered from preliminary exploration can inspire more focused inquiries and in-depth investigations. While cleaning and preparation prepare the data for later data analysis tasks, thorough documentation guarantees that your research remains orderly and repeatable.

We then use machine learning (ML) to build a model. This model evaluates vulnerability scan results independently, thereby minimizing the requirement for manual intervention. Algorithms for machine learning take in knowledge from previous data, improving their ability to appraise new data. The efficacy and accuracy of our vulnerability evaluation are considerably increased by this dynamic approach, strengthening the safety record of the program as a result.

# Advantages

These approaches should typically have an accuracy rate of more than 90%, which makes them extremely dependable in differentiating between real vulnerabilities and false positives. By doing this, the chance of missing important flaws or wasting energy on false alarms is reduced. With the aid of data analysis techniques, it is possible to examine the data exported from reporting software and spot trends, patterns, and other information that might guide decision-making. For diverse stakeholders, the data can be presented in a clear and intelligible way thanks to data visualization techniques like Tableau.

Additionally, the automation of risk assessment results in a notable decrease in the need on human resources. This not only results in significant cost savings, but also enables quicker reactions to new security threats. The expedited procedure guarantees that urgent problems are quickly detected and fixed, strengthening the entire security system.

# Conclusion 

A significant step in improving the safety of our software applications is the application of AI and ML techniques to software vulnerability assessment. These cutting-edge technologies provide a high level of accuracy, the possibility for considerable cost savings, and quick response times, all of whom are crucial in the current cybersecurity scene. We demonstrate both the creative upgrades to our software and our dedication to aggressively identifying and reducing security vulnerabilities by giving our findings to our sponsor. We are convinced that as we advance, the combination of AI and ML will strengthen our defenses and enable us to stay ahead of new threats, ultimately assuring a more secure and safe digital environment for everyone involved.
